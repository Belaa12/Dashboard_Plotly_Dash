# Dashboard_Plotly_Dash

In this project, I will act as a newly hired data scientist by XYZAutomotives. My goal is to analyze the impact of recession on automobile sales.

The objective of this part of the Final assignment is to create dashboards to contain my plots and charts and to provide the directors with the ability to select a particular report or a period of time so they can discuss the data in detail.

I will create dashboards using Dash and Plotly and then add user-interactions to my dashboards.
